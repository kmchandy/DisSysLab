## 🧩 3.1 Transformers that use AI

## 🎯 Goal
- Build AI agents.

## 📍 What’s an AI transformer?
A **transformer** is a Python function that has a single argument and returns a single value. An AI transformer calls an AI service to compute the return value. Think of the AI transformer as a function that receives a message and outputs a message which is computed by an AI service such as OpenAI or Gemini.

You will need to register with the AI provider and get a key to run these examples and build your own AI agents.
