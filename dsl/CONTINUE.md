🔄 DisSysLab Restart Checklist
1. Where we left off

We have a teaching-focused framework for distributed systems:

Networks = blocks + connections.

Blocks = generators, transformers, recorders, fan-in, fan-out.

More advanced: SimpleAgent, Agent (acknowledged, not yet used in the beginner path).

We just finished a Chapter 8 SecuritySwitchingAgent using run() + wait_for_any_port().

✅ You asked to introduce dict messages early, so students see:

{"text": "This is great!"}
    → {"text": "This is great!", "sentiment": "positive"}


instead of raw strings.

2. Repo structure (current)

dsl/core.py — base classes (Agent, Network, etc.)

dsl/block_lib/

generators/

transformers/

recorders/

fan_in/

fan_out/

dsl/examples/

intro/

ch08_agents/

(others: GPT, numpy, etc.)

3. Current teaching plan

Basic Level (Bea’s on-ramp):

Introduce blocks + connections.

Build a pipeline with generator → transformer → recorder.

Debug blocks in isolation (attach generic generator/recorder).

Next Step (when you return):

Shift examples to use dict messages early.

E.g., generator produces {"text": "..."}, transformer adds a field ("sentiment", "length", "tokens").

Show recorder printing whole dicts → emphasize streams of structured data.

Long-term: Natural language interface (US ↔ Bea) where Bea builds apps by saying “make a transformer” etc.

4. Next concrete tasks

When you’re back:

Write a simple dict-message transformer:

def add_sentiment(msg: dict) -> dict:
    text = msg.get("text", "")
    sentiment = "positive" if "great" in text.lower() else "neutral"
    return {**msg, "sentiment": sentiment}


Then wrap it as a block.

Update intro examples so generators emit dicts and recorders print dicts.

Add debug examples (generator + transformer + recorder) that show dict flow.

Prepare a student exercise:

Change delays of generators.

Add new fields to messages (source, time).

Extend transformer (add "length": len(text)).

5. How to restart

Option 1: Open this chat thread (bookmark link).

Option 2: Start a new chat with:

“Restart DisSysLab at dict messages introduction.”
I’ll reload this plan.

Option 3: Look at your repo’s dsl/examples/ and pick up from ch08_agents/security_switching_agent.py.

✅ That’s it — this one-page refresher will get you back into the mindset quickly.

Would you like me to also sketch the first dict-message teaching example now (so you’ll have code ready when you return)?
