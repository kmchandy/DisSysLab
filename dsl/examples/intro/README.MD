# ðŸ“˜ Put Blocks Together: Build Your First Distributed Application

These short examples introduce ideas underlying DisSysLab, a framework for building
Python distributed applications. The central idea is that of a *block* â€” an object 
with lists of input and output ports. A block sends messages on its output ports and
receives messages on its input ports. A network is a set of blocks and connections.
A connection is a 4-tuple `(from_block, from_port, to_block, to_port)` which specifies
that messages sent by `from_block` on `from_port` are received by `to_block` on `to_port`.

Some network structures, such as *pipelines*, can be specified without listing connections.
A network is itself a block. You can build networks of networks. An atomic block is specified
by a function that receives and sends messages. By convention, if a block has a single output 
port then that port is called `"out"`. Likewise, if a block has a single input port then that 
port is called `"in"`.

A pipeline is a sequence of blocks:  
`[ generate ] ---> [ transform ] ---> ... ---> [ transform ] ---> [ record ]`

Each example has two Specifications:
- âœ… **Block and Connection Specification** â€” explicitly shows each block and connection
- ðŸš€ **Pipeline Specification** â€” uses the `pipeline({...})` helper for simplicity

You may run these examples in a script or Jupyter notebook. Make sure your environment is active.
