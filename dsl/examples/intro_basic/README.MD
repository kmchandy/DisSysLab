# ðŸ“˜ Build Distributed Applications by Connecting Blocks

The goal of this set of examples is to show you how to specify a network as a dictionary (`dict`) blocks and a list of connections. The keys and values in the block dictionary are names of blocks and their specifications, respectively. A connection is a 4-tuple `(from_block, from_port, to_block, to_port)` which specifies that messages sent by `from_block` on `from_port` are received by `to_block` on `to_port`.

The first example also shows how to create a diagram showing connections by calling `draw`. The example uses the Agent class and types (sub-classes) of Agents called `generator`, `transform`, and `record`. A generate block has a single outport (short for "output port"), a transform block has a single inport and a single outport, and a record block has a single inport. By convention, a single outport is called "out" and a single inport is called "in". 

### generate
A generate block is specified by a list or a Python generator; the generate block sends messages from the specified list or function on its outport. 

Examples:
- `generate(["hello", "world"])'
- 

### transform
A transform block is specified by a function; it applies the function to messages it receives on its inport and sends the results on its outports.

### transform
 and it sends messages on its output port. A transform block has a single input port and a single output port; it applies a function to messages it receives on its input port and sends results on its output port. 

A generate block is specified by the list or Python generator function that it wraps. A
