**DisSysLab (aka `dsl`)** is a lightweight framework where you build distributed programs as **graphs of plain Python callables**. Each node is just a function â€” often a call into a library such NumPy, SciPy, or OpenAI. Edges carry messages. Agents run concurrently.

DSL is designed for first-year undergrads. This is an early release. It will evolve and feedback is welcome.
