Module 10: Building Apps with DisSysLab

Learn how to build complete distributed applications from scratch.

This module teaches the systematic process for going from idea to working app:
1. Answer 3 key questions (Sources? Sinks? Transforms?)
2. Design your network (draw the diagram)
3. Build incrementally (layer by layer)
4. Test and refine

Files in this module:
- QUICKSTART.md: One-page cheat sheet with essential templates
- BUILD_APP.md: Complete guide to building any distributed app
- DEBUGGING.md: Troubleshooting guide for common issues (coming soon)

What you'll learn:
- The 3 essential questions for any app
- How to design complex networks (fanin, fanout, routing)
- Building incrementally (not all at once!)
- Testing strategies
- Debugging techniques

Prerequisites:
- Modules 1-9 (especially Module 9: Connectors)
- Understanding of sources, transforms, sinks
- Basic Python programming

Time to complete: 3-4 hours

Start here:
1. Read QUICKSTART.md (5 min) - get the essential templates
2. Read BUILD_APP.md (30 min) - learn the systematic process
3. Build your first app following the process (1-2 hours)
4. When stuck, consult DEBUGGING.md

Remember: Every app is just Sources → Transforms → Sinks!
